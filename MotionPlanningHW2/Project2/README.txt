# Overview of functionality

In order to run the program, I opened run_rrt in VS Code and clicked the run button for rrt.  PRM is not functional, I accept 0 points for this.

I'm unfamiliar with python, but since it doesn't require compilation, I believe you should be able to click the run button for the the program in any IDE. I used the starter code, so running should be extremely similar.  

I believe changing parameters should be pretty self evident as the code uses the starting codes paramaters.  I changed initial and goal points by editing the env files.


# Issues
- For rrt_bidirectional_connect, it only shows the branching from one tree.
-Could not implement PRM at all.
-Vrem didn't go as well as it could have.  Also ran out of time.


References
Lots of my implementations were inspired by this text book and other online resources:
LaValle, S. M. (2006). Planning Algorithms. Cambridge University Press. Planning Algorithms. https://msl.cs.uiuc.edu/planning/bookbig.pdf

I also used chatGPT to help give me an understanding, but I did not directly copy generated code for my final solutions.
I left generated ChatGPT code in PRM, but was not able to figure out PRM.  Please disregard and give me 0 points for PRM.  I do not claim to have 
created code that I did not personally make and understand.
