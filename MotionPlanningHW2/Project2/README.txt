# Overview of functionality

In order to run the program, I opened run_rrt in VS Code and clicked the run button.

I'm unfamiliar with python, but since it doesn't require compilation, I believe you should be able to click the run button for the the program in any IDE. I used the starter code, so running should be extremely similar.  

I believe changing parameters should be pretty self evident as the code uses the starting codes paramaters.  I changed initial and goal points by editing the env files.


# Issues
- For rrt_connect, it only shows the branching from one tree.

Lots of my implementations were inspired by this text book and other online resources:

I also used chatGPT to help give me an understanding, but I did not directly copy generated code for my final solutions.
